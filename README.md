# Travel Agency

Travel Agency is a comprehensive Java-based project that helps users manage their travelagency data. It consists of two primary components: `Travel-Agency-Service`, a JavaFX application for managing travelagency data such as bookings, flights, and hotels for a specific customer, and `Travel-Agency-API`, an API that provides the necessary endpoints for interacting with the travelagency data.
